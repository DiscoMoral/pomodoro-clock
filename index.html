              The Pomodoro technique is a tool that allows you to allocate your time wisely.
              You set an interval during which you will work hard on the task without distractions. 
              After working, we take a break for five minutes. You can take breaks for longer periods of time, 
              but then you need to increase the working time.
              The Pomodoro technique was created by Francesco Cirillo. 
              In his student days, he used a kitchen timer in the shape of a tomato to organize his learning process. 
              He experimented with different time intervals. In the end, he found the 25/5 time to be the most optimal.

                <li class="pomorodo__item">
                  More importantly, take all necessary steps to keep your mind on your work during the pomodoro and not interrupt it.

                <li class="pomorodo__item">
                  You need to protect your pomodoro from both internal and external distractions. Avoid checking emails, social media accounts, 
                  weather forecasts, news and any other distractions that can take your attention away from the task at hand.
                </li>
                <li class="pomorodo__item">
                  Different implementations of the Pomodoro technique use different time slots for task segments and breaks.

                <li class="pomorodo__item">
                  For breaks, it is highly recommended to choose an activity that contrasts with the task. For example, 
                  a person working at a computer should step away from the desk and engage in some type of physical activity.
