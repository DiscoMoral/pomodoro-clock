# pomodoro-clock
My second in-house project where I implemented a pomodoro counter

I took a ready-made idea - Pomodoro counter, and tried to make it myself.

The code looks big, I'm sure it could have been written simpler, but the goal was to make the project myself, relying only on the documentation.

The project uses HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstap and the addition of a ready-made solution - accordion
